# Serghei's Vim Configuration

This repository contains my personal configuration for Vim that I use on
the daily and port around from system to system with me.  This is the second
repository I clone — after [my dotfiles](https://github.com/sergeyklay/dotfiles)
— when settling in on a new system.

This configuration uses default-style keybindings and known to work with Vim
7.4 and later.
